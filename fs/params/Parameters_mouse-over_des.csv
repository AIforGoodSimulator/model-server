ABM model,permanently_asymptomatic_cases,"If an individual becomes infected, the infection progresses through a series of disease states, as shown in the report page. The passage through stages happens according to probabilities taken from the literature. Permanently asymptomatic cases is the number of infected individuals which never show symptoms and eventually recover from the disease."
ABM model,area_covered_by_isoboxes,"Area of the refugee camps may camp covered by isoboxes. The homes of people with the same ethnic or national background are spatially clustered, and people interact more frequently with others from the same background as themselves. To simulate ethnicities or nationalities in our camp, we assigned each household to one of eight “backgrounds” in proportion to the self-reported countries of origin of people. For each of the eight simulated backgrounds, we randomly selected one tent or isobox to be the seed for the cluster. We assigned the x nearest unassigned households to that background, where x is the number of households with that background."
ABM model,relative_strength_of_interaction,"Interaction rate between individuals, modelled as dependent of ethnical background and closeness of area around each individual home.  Individuals encounter each other more frequently if they co-occupy a small area than if they co-occupy a large area for the same amount of time. To obtain the interaction rate between individuals i and j from the relative encounter rate, we scaled by a factor g(ij) to account for ethnicity or country of origin. In particular, g(ij) = 1 if individuals i and j have the same background, and g(ij) = 0.2 otherwise."
ABM model,smaller_movement_radius,"Individuals move about outside their households, and interact with individuals from other households as they move. We assumed that each individual occupies a circular home range centred on its household, and uses all parts of its home range equally. Two individuals may interact if their home ranges overlap. Smaller_movement_radius  is used when we want to model a low interaction environment where we assume that people do not wander to far away from their home "
ABM model,larger_movement_radius,"Individuals move about outside their households, and interact with individuals from other households as they move. We assumed that each individual occupies a circular home range centred on its household, and uses all parts of its home range equally. Two individuals may interact if their home ranges overlap. Larger_movement_radius  is used when we want to model a high  interaction environment where we assume that people can wander quite  far  from their home "
