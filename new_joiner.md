# Communication

We use Slack workspace

to communicate. Check out #db and #general channels to start with once you join.

Use join link https://join.slack.com/t/aiforgood-simulator/shared_invite/zt-e2zp3l12-yBmAEHKgj35Ld2cbZf7cTQ to join.

Our version of Slack does not have screensharing, you can use private webex to have screensharing session.  

# Azure
Model server production deployment is on Azure. Contact Stefan Cronjaeger and Andrei Varanovich on slack or email to get access. 
There is a known bug with Azure sandbox we use where you can not use existing Microsoft account to connect to 
Azure. Setup virgin email address and send that to Stefan/Andrei and be careful to never create account, 
instead always use invite link.

To use az console you would need use service principal and associated password, contact Kostya Titorenko 
on slack to request one.

Model server is setup to deploy on commit, see https://github.com/AIforGoodSimulator/model-server/blob/master/README.md 
for details how to deploy.
